## Version 0.1.0

Made under the hood improvements to generating the icon pack with the scripts. Note that this icon pack does not currently support the solid version of the Iconoir icons - therefore, no new icons have been introduced in this update as the new ones are only affecting the solid variant.

## Version 0.0.9

Uses latest icons as of late Jan 2024. For example, there is now an ice-cream icon.

## Version 0.0.8

Uses latest Icons as of Dec 2023. Improved code formatting, comment docs, and lowered Min Dart SDK for greater backwards compatibility.

## Version 0.0.7

Optimized TTF output quality.

## Version 0.0.6

Updated to have bold and regular weight.

## Version 0.0.5

Corrected example mistake in README document.

## Version 0.0.4

Includes generated initial TTF file and generated the Dart code. Prepared to be published to pub repo.
